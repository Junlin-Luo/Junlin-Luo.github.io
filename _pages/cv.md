Education
======
* Undergraduate at Tsinghua University, Beijing, 2021-2025(Expected)
  * Tsien Excellence in Engineering Program(钱学森力学班)
  * Theoretical and Applied Mechanics
  * GPA: 3.95/4.00

Research experience
======
* Fall 2024(Ongoing): **Symbolic regressions for PDE directly driven by data(solution).**
  * Advisor: Prof. Lu Lu, Yale University, New Haven
  * Build an end-to-end model to directly regress the analytical form of the PDE from the solution
  * Aiming to construct a foundation model faster than heuristic PDE discovery using genetic algorithms.


* Fall 2023 - Summer 2024: **Investigating abiotic particles accumulation behind cylinders in microfluidic chips.**(A Talk delivered)
  * Advisor: Prof. Moran Wang, Tsinghua University, Beijing
  *  Discover the pattern of the ’streamer-like’ growing of abiotic particles behind the cylinder in microfluidic chips.
  * Attempt to propose dynamical equations to physically describe the growing patterns
  *  Investigate the reasons why abiotic particles accumulate behind the cylinder without the existence of the biofilm, which is considered as the reason why its counterpart, biotic streamer, forms.

* Summer 2023: **Seeking the most informative specimen shape for learning constitutive models.**(One Paper Published in *Extreme Mechanics Letter*)
  * Advisor: Prof. Juner Zhu, Northeastern University, Boston
  * Propose the idea —— ”Utilitizing entropy criterion to help quantify the information contained”. in experiments
with different sample shapes.
  *  Demonstrate that different testing shapes in nano-indentation lead to different ’information entropy value of the stress state’, which could indicate the diversity of the stress state.

* Fall 2022 - Spring 2023: **Ouzo effect in confined space.**
  * Advisor: Prof. Cunjing Lv, Tsinghua University, Beijing
  *  Conduct the experiments and propose a new attribute to quantitatively describe the phase transition of ternary
liquid evaporation in confined space.
  * Explain how the interface shape’s destruction interferes with the symmetry of the fluid field pattern.
